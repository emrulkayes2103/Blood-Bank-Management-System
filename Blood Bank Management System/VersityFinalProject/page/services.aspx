        <h2>About thousand of people now registered with our online blood donation appointment booking service</h2>
        <p class="lead" style="text-align: left; margin-left: 30px;">
            Our easy-to-use online service makes it easier for blood donors to book appointments to give blood and save
           lives.<br>
            The move from donors making provisional bookings online that often required a call back or further email correspondence
          to secure a booking,<br>
            to a modern, personally managed service is timesaving and easier for donors.<br>
            People can register
           as a donor online, arrange, amend or cancel their own appointments and update their
            <br>
            personal details. They can also
          share their experiences of giving blood on Facebook from the site, helping to promote donation among their friends.
        </p>
        <p class="lead" style="text-align: left; margin-left: 30px;">
            “Donors are  able to use the contact centre to book appointments, but we hope that the success of the online appointment booking system will encourage more donors<br>
            to register online and begin using this as a reliable and quick route to booking appointments to give blood.
        </p>
        <p class="lead" style="text-align: left; margin-left: 30px;">
            “This is a great example of how modern technology can be used to help save lives, improve efficiency and make things
            easier for those<br>
            who want to give back."
        </p>
        <p class="lead" style="text-align: left; margin-left: 30px;">
            “It’s an impressive milestone and one we hope to build on. Giving blood is so important and can make
            the difference between<br>
            life and death.”
